## Linear Extension Allows Stricter Contracts

* Does my sorting function return sensible result?<sup><small>1</small></sup>
    ```haskell
        sort :: [Int] -> SortedList Int
        -- vs.
        sort :: [Int] ⊸ SortedList Int
    ```
* Can I do in-place updates?

* Do I close my file handles?

# Linear Arrows: Conditional Consumption

`f :: s ⊸ t` means that: 

* **if** `(f u)` is _consumed_ exactly once,

* **then** the argument `u` is _consumed_ exactly once.

--

_Consume_ ::=

* To consume a **value of atomic base type** (like `Int` or `Ptr`) exactly once, just _evaluate_ it.

* To consume a **function** value exactly once, apply it to one argument, and consume its result exactly once.

* To consume a **value of an algebraic datatype** exactly once, pattern-match on it, and consume all its linear components exactly once.

---

# Example: List Concatenation

```haskell
-- List datatype
data List a where
  Nil  :: List a
  Cons :: a  ⊸ List a ⊸ List a
```

--

```haskell
-- Linear concatenation function
concat :: List a ⊸ List a ⊸ List a
concat Nil         ys = ys
concat (Cons x xs) ys = Cons x (concat xs ys)
```

---

# Backward Compatability for Datatypes 

Data constructors are linear by default; previous list equivalent:

```haskell
data List1 a = Nil1 | Cons1 a (List1 a)
```

--

Same with GADTs unless both holds:

* a module turns on the `-XLinearTypes` extension and

* uses the regular arrow for one of its GADTs

---

## Datatypes and Linearity (ctd.)

**Linear Pairs**


```haskell
f1 :: (Int, Int) -> (Int, Int)
f1 x = case x of (a, b) -> (a, a)

f2 :: (Int, Int) ⊸ (Int, Int)
f2 x = case x of (a, b) -> (b, a)

```

--

**Unrestricted Constructors**

```haskell
data Ur a where  -- Unrestricted resource
    Ur :: a -> Ur a

f3 :: (Int, Ur Int) ⊸ (Int, Int)
f3 x = case x of (a, Ur _) -> (42, a) -- is this OK?
```

---

# Interplay Between `⊸` And `->`

```haskell
f :: s ⊸ t
g :: s -> t
g x = f x -- is this OK?
```
--
```haskell
sum  :: [Int] ⊸ Int
(++) :: [Int] ⊸ [Int] ⊸ Int -- concatenation
f    :: [Int] ⊸ [Int] -> Int

f xs ys = sum (xs ++ ys) + sum ys   -- is this OK?
```

---

# Interplay Between `⊸` And `->` (contd.)

```haskell
f :: Int ⊸ Int
g :: (Int -> Int) -> Bool
h = g f -- Legal???
```
In general, do we want `⊸ <: ->`?

--

Compiler will take care of it:

```haskell
h = g f ↝  g (λx -> f x)    -- s.c. η-expansion
```

---

# Multiplicity Polymorphism

Is `map` of `(a ⊸ b) -> [a] ⊸ [b]` or of `(a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]`?

--

Neither. It is:

```haskell
map :: ∀{p} a b. (a %p -> b) -> [a] %p -> [b]
```

--

Abbreviate as follows:


* `a ⊸ b` ::= `a %1 -> b`

* `a -> b` ::= `a %Many -> b`

Thus, there are two concrete multiplicities: `1` and `Many`.

---

# Quiz: Typing Function Composition

```haskell
(◦) :: ∀{p} {q}.
  (b %p -> c) %1 ->
  (a %q -> b) %p ->
  a           %? ->      -- what's `?`?
  c
  
(f ◦ g) x = f (g x)
```
---

count: false

# Quiz: Typing Function Composition

```haskell
(◦) :: ∀{p} {q}.
  (b %p -> c) %1 ->
  (a %q -> b) %p ->
  a           %{p·q} ->
  c
  
(f ◦ g) x = f (g x)
```

---

# Linearity for Return Types?

Old trick — use CPS (continuation passing):
```haskell
f :: A -> (B ⊸ r) ⊸ r -- effectively, `f` accepts `A` & returns linear `B`
```

--

Especially useful for monads:

```haskell
type IO p a  -- means: construct value `a` that can only be used
             --        with multiplicity `p`

return :: a %p -> IO p a
(>>=)  :: IO p a ⊸ (a %p -> IO q b) ⊸ IO q b
```

--

```haskell
foo :: SomeLinearMonad a
foo = do
  linearValue <- action1
  -- ...
```

# Safe Resource Management

# Unsafe In-place Mutation (pre-linear)

```haskell
array :: Int -> [(Int, a)] -> Array a
array size pairs = runST do
  ma ← newMArray size     -- create mutable array
  forM_ pairs (write ma)  -- monadic for-loop to fill it
  unsafeFreeze ma         -- turn it into immutable array -- UNSAFE!

```

---

# Safe File Handling

```haskell
firstLine :: FilePath -> IO 1 String
firstLine fp = do
  h ← openFile fp
  (h, Ur xs) ← readLine h  -- threading the handle
  closeFile h
  return xs 
```

```haskell
openFile  :: FilePath -> IO 1 Handle
readLine  :: Handle   ⊸ IO 1 (Handle, Ur String)
closeFile :: Handle   ⊸ IO 1 ()
```

# Linear Constraints

# Type Classes as Implicits 

```haskell
foo :: a -> String
foo a = {- what could that be? -}
```

--

.left-half[
But with a constraint: 
```haskell
class Show a where
  show :: a -> String

showTwice :: Show a => a -> String
showTwice a = show a ++ show a
```
]
--
.right-half[
Translation (inside GHC)
```haskell
data ShowD a = ShowD {
  show :: a -> String }

showTwice' :: ShowD a -> a -> String
showTwice' d a = show d a ++ show d a
```
]

# Backup

# Threats To Validity

* Huge overhaul: change the whole `base`, also modification of GHC Core

* Retrofitting still not completely thought of

    * GHC Proposals process is staling
    
    * Multiplicity 0 is already dropped

* Type inference is not formally developed

* Generally, elaboration of LH to $\lambda_{\to}^q$ (or GHC Core) is not 100% clear

---

# On the bright side

* A lot of work has been done.

--

* Efficiency could be worked out?

    * some reported in the paper (ad-hoc);
    
    * some of «cardinality&nbsp;analysis» subsumed by multiplicity annotations
    (good for inling: e.g. don't inline `(λx -> x ++ x) expensive`).

--

* Many applications in mind:

    * network-communication with 0 allocations,
    * GC-less, manual allocations,
    * resource-safe I/O,
    * safe API for the `streaming` library,
    * DSL for “printable” 3D-models.

- Strictness & Divergence

.left-half[
```haskell
f :: a ⊸ (a, Bool)
f x = (x, True)
```
]
.right-half[
``` haskell
g :: [Int] ⊸ [Int]
g xs = repeat 1 ++ xs
```
]

- Exceptions

- Single type universe

- Can play nicely with dependent function types too as shown by Idris 2.
